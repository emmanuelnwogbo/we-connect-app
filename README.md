# we-connect-templates

this branch includes only the templates for the front end of the we-connect application.

the templates were bootstrapped with materialise css and the materialise icon.
I also use font awesome for some of icons.

the index.html file contains s little jquery as it is needed to initialise the materialize css sidenav.

You might notice that I avoid repeating myself in certain aspects of the template as we'll be using reactjs eventually.

example:

I only create a header once, as well as a sidenav once.

I've built the templates with the knowledge that they are eventually going to be guidelines for building the react components later in development.

the html files include
*an addbusiness form template,
*a login form template,
*a signup form template,
*a template for when a user clicks on a business,
*a template for the front end and for search results, as well as the header and navbar.
